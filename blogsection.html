            <b>What is the ideal mindset of a succesful businessperson? </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Business mindset: a way of thinking that enables you to uncover and
            see problems as opportunities, and then turning those opportunities
            into a business. It is an understanding that everything around us is
            the result of someone having an idea and then executing it.<span
              id="dots"
              >...</span
            ><span id="more">
              An entrepreneurial mindset is characterized by curiosity,
              creativity, risk-taking, resilience, self-efficacy,
              problem-solving abilities, a passion for learning and growth, an
              openness to feedback and change, and excellent communication and
              networking skills. <br /><br /><b
                >What is the difference between a businessperson and an
                enterpreneur</b
              ><br /><br />
              An entrepreneur is an individual having an exclusive idea to
              establish a new venture. A businessman is an individual who
              establishes a business with an old business idea. Entrepreneurs
              are market leaders. Businessmen are market players. So basically I
              think it is right to say all enterpreneurs are businesspeople but
              not all businesspeople are enterpreneurs</span

              Lake Victoria and to identify it as the source of the Nile. This
              is located in Uganda in Jinja district in Busoga region. The
              Basoga are the major inhabitants of Jinja district. They are very
              friendly and hospitable people. The Basoga are well known for
              making delicious chapatis which are used to make Uganda's special:
              Rolex. The rolex is a combination vegetables fried in eggs, which
              are wrapped with a chapati. Visiting the Source of the Nile is
              surely worth while. There are many more tourist sites in Jinja.
              Namely: Itanda falls, Rippon Falls, the palace of the

            The essential nutrients are vitamins, minerals, protein, fats,
            water, and carbohydrates.They are essential because they perform
            different and unique functions in our body as they support the reproduction system of a person, good health and <span id="dots3">...</span

              ><br /><br />
              There are 13 vitamins which have specific functions to keep the
              body working properly. Some vitamins help you resist infections
              and keep your nerves healthy, while others may help your body get
              energy from food or help your blood clot properly. By following
              the Dietary Guidelines, you will get enough of most of these
              vitamins from food. <br /><br /><b
                >What are the 13 vitamins your body needs?</b
              ><br />
              The vitamins your body needs on a daily basis are vitamins A, C,
              D, E, K and the B vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9 and B12).
              You need vitamins C, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7 and B9 in your diet
              every day. That is because they are not stored in the body and you
              remove any excess of them in your urine, so these vitamins need to
              be replenished daily. Vitamins A, D, E and K are all fat-soluble,
              and so can be stored in the body, while B12 is water soluble and
              so can be stored in the liver. Because you store an excess of
              these vitamins, you do not necessarily need them in your diet
              every day, but it is important that you have enough stored to
              equal your daily amount if you are not getting it in your
              diet</span

              People always wonder why Mona Lisa does not have any eyebrows.
              This mystery has been solved, all thanks to an engineer named
              Pascal Cotte. When Da Vinci had painted Mona Lisa, he indeed
              painted her eyebrows but over time these eyebrows were eroded due
              to cleaning over time to the point where it is no longer visible
